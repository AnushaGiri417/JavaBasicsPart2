The selection sort is a combination of searching and sorting.
It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and
moved to the sorted subarray.

   {38,52,9,18,6,62,13}
==>{6,52,9,18,38,62,13} --->New sorted list. (6 and 38 are swapped)

-When i=0, j will start form 1
-After compilaion of loop, min=4 (6 is at index 4)
-Then numbers in position i=0 and min=4 will get swapped
-New list will be
    {6,52,9,18,38,62,13}

--When i=1, j will start form 2
 -After compilaion of loop, min=2 (9 is at index 2)
 -Then numbers in position i=1 and min=2 will get swapped
 -New list will be
    {6,9,52,18,38,62,13}

This is the final list but it works in step. Like, it finds smallest first and then brings it to the front.
Finds next bigger and puts it behind the smallest and goes on until the last index is reached

The lagorithm maintain two subarrays in a given array.
1) The subarray which is already sorted
2) The remaining subarray which is unsorted
